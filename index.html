                <h3>COOL EXEC, HEART OF STEEL</h3>
                <p>Tony Stark is the wealthy son of industrialist and weapons manufacturer Howard Stark and his wife, Maria. Tony grew up a genius with a brilliant mind for technology and inventions and, naturally, followed in his father’s footsteps, inheriting Stark Industries upon his parents’ untimely death. Tony designed many weapons of war for Stark Industries, far beyond what any other company was creating, while living the lifestyle of a bon vivant.
                Fate would take a dark turn for Tony Stark once he decided to consult on a weapons contract overseas in enemy terrain. An improvised explosive device exploded underneath Tony’s transport, and he was brought to the brink of death.
                Awakening as a prisoner of the warlord Wong-Chu, Tony made a gruesome discovery: the explosion had sent a piece of shrapnel mere inches from his heart. It was only the timely intervention of fellow captive and engineer Yinsen that kept the shrapnel at bay.While held captive, and forced to work on weapons, Tony turned his near-death experience into inspiration. What if he could power an iron suit that would not only keep the shrapnel from killing Tony, but also help him to escape?
                Combining their genius, Tony and Yinsen built a mighty suit of iron armor that would be dubbed Iron Man. This first suit left a lot of room for improvement, but it still did what Tony couldn’t do alone. Yinsen sacrificed his life so the final preparations could be made, and Tony, wearing the Iron Man suit for the first time, escaped and returned to the United States a changed man.With full access to his equipment, Tony built a new, more streamlined suit of armor—the first of many updated versions he would create—and dedicated his life to fighting threats to the world.
                </p>
                <h3>IRON MAN</h3>
                <P>
                    Since that first suit built in a cave, Tony has created dozens of new suits and upgrades over the years. However, throughout the 50-plus Iron Man models, there are common offensive and defense capabilities found in most iterations.
                    The primary weapon contained within every suit, the repulsor rays use energy pulses to repel and disrupt enemies and are generated through the suit’s gauntlets. The suit’s booster jets enable Stark to fly fast enough to break the sound barrier, and maneuver more quickly than any fighter jet.
                    Iron Man’s helmet provides Tony with a heads-up display that gives him 360-degree vision, access to information about his surroundings and enemies, and the ability to transmit and block transmissions along any frequency. The helmet also gives Tony a degree of resistance to EMP and psychic-based attacks.

                    A weapon centered in Iron Man’s chest, the unibeam is capable of projecting dazzling light, and can also be used as a powerful force beam that is even more powerful than the repulsor ray.

                    Each of Tony’s suits provides a full range of telecommunications, including the ability to jam and transmit on any frequency, and sophisticated artificial intelligence capable of piloting Tony to safety should he be rendered unconscious.
                    Beyond his all-purpose suits, Tony has created specialized armor for specific scenarios. Some notable examples include the Hulkbuster armor (so-named as its size and strength allow Tony to stand toe-to-toe with the Hulk, when needed), along with deep-space, underwater and stealth suits.

                    One thing common to most of Iron Man’s recent suits is the integration of Extremis, an attempt to re-create the super-soldier serum with many modifications. When using Extremis, Tony can interface with his brain’s repair center, which allows him to rebuild his body from scratch. Essentially, Tony is able to merge his mind, body, and armor in unprecedented ways. He can “armor up” in mere seconds—with armor stored within himself—gains split-second reaction times, and can even generate new internal organs to replace the old. Unfortunately, Extremis is also vulnerable to being hacked, and the Skrulls and other organizations have done just that.
                </P>
                <h3>REPULSING THE REPULSIVE</h3>
                <p>
                    Numerous villains have made up Iron Man’s gallery of enemies, with many of them similarly armor-based in order to counter Iron Man’s abilities. The Russians have created both the Crimson Dynamo and Titanium Man to try and stop the threat posed by Iron Man, and have fought Stark through numerous iterations.

                    The Mandarin is one of Iron Man’s fiercest archvillains. A tactical, mystical and technological genius, the Mandarin sought ultimate power, and often Iron Man is the only one smart and strong enough to stand in his way. In fact, the Mandarin, working with warlord Wong-Chu, captured Tony Stark and indirectly brought about the creation of Iron Man. The Mandarin has returned again and again to pit his magic and intellect against Stark technology.
                    A competing industrialist, Obadiah Stane, never lost his taste for weapons and was a great fan of psychological warfare. He took hostile control of Tony Stark’s company for a time, and though he perished in battle, his descendants are perhaps even more ruthless than he was.

                    Another rival industrialist on par with Stane, Justin Hammer is interested in the accumulation of wealth and power and sees Tony’s altruism as a big stumbling block toward that goal.Other foes of note for Tony through the years have included the Ghost, Radioactive Man, and nefarious organizations like Advanced Idea Mechanics (AIM).

                <h3>4-F Forever?</h3>
                <p>
                    Envious of his friend Bucky Barnes’ military enlistment, and undeterred by his own multiple rejections by the U.S. Army, physical weakling Steve Rogers made one more attempt to join the march of men to fight for their country in the dark days of World War II. Rogers’ valiant wish to fight bullies wherever they were grabbed the attention of scientist Dr. Abraham Erskine, and he handpicked the idealistic young man for the Army’s Super-Soldier program under his supervision.
                    Though Rogers learned of Erskine’s disastrous previous attempts to realize a super-soldier, Germany’s so-called “Red Skull,” he braved the process and emerged from it a new man. With a powerful body and heightened speed and reflexes, Rogers faced his first challenge when forced to chase down Dr. Erskine’s assassin immediately following the experiment. In doing so, he also learned of the involvement of Hydra, the Nazi science division, in the doctor’s murder.
                    The Army moved swiftly to create a colorful, star-spangled persona for Steve Rogers they called “Captain America,” and put him on a tour to sell war bonds. Chafing at what he felt was inaction, Rogers jumped at the chance to join the real fighting when he received news of the capture of his friend Barnes’ army division and rushed to rescue the soldiers. Upon the successful completion of the unplanned mission—and a brief meeting with the Red Skull himself—Rogers determined his path as a one-man fighting force.
                </p>
                <h3>Lasting Friendships</h3>
                <p>Steve Rogers’ forthright attitude and positive disposition has attracted a select group of people into his inner circle of friends. His longest companion is James Buchanan “Bucky” Barnes, who Rogers met in his Hell’s Kitchen neighborhood in New York and formed a close friendship with. Despite Barnes’ enlistment in the Army and Rogers’ career as Captain America during the war, the two found each other and united to form a solid battlefront against the Axis. When Barnes seemingly fell to his death, Steve Rogers felt as if a brother had been taken from him.
                    Though his time with Peggy Carter was comparatively short to his friendship with Bucky Barnes, Rogers’ feelings toward the capable young woman had begun to blossom into romance before his crash into the Atlantic. The two reunited in the present day, but Carter’s advanced age and her weakening health prevented them from continuing what they’d begun during the war. Regardless, Rogers maintained his connection with the woman until her death from natural causes and looks forward to what the future may bring with his relationship to Sharon Carter, Peggy’s great-niece and S.H.I.E.L.D.’s Agent 13.

                    Through their partnership in the Avengers and S.H.I.E.L.D., Steve Rogers and Natasha Romanoff have formed a friendship, something the infamous Black Widow does not offer lightly. Despite moments of Rogers’ distrust of Romanoff’s decisions and her prodding of him to fully embrace the modern world, an underlying understanding exists between the two heroes.
                    Captain America has also formed a bond with Sam Wilson, known as the Falcon, who has shown intense loyalty to Rogers. His relationship with Iron Man Tony Stark remains a difficult one to categorize, given the rift the two have had.
                </p>
                <h3>The First Avenger</h3>
                <p>
                    After truly joining the fight in World War II thanks to his rescue of captured troops, including his old friend Bucky Barnes, Captain America quickly earned the respect and admiration. And it was not only from the soldiers he fought alongside, but also from British secret agent Peggy Carter, an expert on Hydra, who had served as Erskine’s assistant on the Super-Soldier program. After a series of battles overseas, Rogers, Barnes, and the Howling Commandos strike force staged an assault on a train carrying Hydra personnel, during which Barnes seemingly fell to his death. Grieving over the loss, Rogers nevertheless continued his campaign against Hydra, while also growing closer to Peggy.
                    Captain America took the fight directly to the Red Skull when he led an invasion of the villain’s base in an all-out attempt to break Hydra’s hold on the war. Rogers successfully boarded the Skull’s aircraft as it took off to launch an attack on the United States. But, when his foe’s powerful Tesseract energy source spelled the Red Skull’s doom, the Super-Soldier found himself with no other alternative then to purposefully crash the plane to stop its pre-programmed drive toward America. While Peggy Carter listened through radio communications with the aircraft, Steve Rogers took it down into the icy North Atlantic waters and apparently to his death.
                    Instead, Captain America entered into a state of suspended animation after the crash, and was recovered in the present day by S.H.I.E.L.D., the successor to Peggy Carter’s Strategic Scientific Reserve. Awakened, he learned of his current status and began the long journey to acclimating to a brand-new, modern world.

                    Almost immediately upon Steve Roger’s revival in the present, he was offered a spot in Nick Fury’s Avengers Initiative and took his place among other heroes, including Iron Man, Thor, Black Widow, Hawkeye, and the Hulk. The group first came together to battle Thor’s brother Loki. However, their initial teamwork was marred by internal strife, chiefly between Rogers and Tony Stark AKA Iron Man, the son of Rogers’ old wartime companion, Howard. The team eventually finally truly came together in the wake of their colleague Phil Coulson’s death at the hands of Loki.
                    In the ensuing battle in New York between the Avengers and Loki and his alien forces, Captain America took charge as a natural leader, coming up with an on-the-spot plan to contain the fight as much as possible to help innocent civilians escape. Loki was defeated. While the Avengers parted ways for the time being, the group had developed mutual respect for one another, as well as the desire to maintain the team when they were needed to address larger threats.

                    After filming a series of Public Service Announcements on different subjects for high school students, Captain America continued to acclimate to modern times and forged friendships with fellow Avenger Natasha Romanoff AKA Black Widow and a USAF operative named Sam Wilson. Rogers was spending much of his time assisting S.H.I.E.L.D. in the field.

                    Both Romanoff and Wilson aided him when it was discovered that Hydra had long ago infiltrated S.H.I.E.L.D. and Rogers was on the run after an attempt to silence him. Rogers found another ally in Sharon Carter, an undercover S.H.I.E.L.D. agent he would later learn was Peggy Carter’s great niece. At this time, Rogers also discovered his old friend Bucky Barnes had not in fact died during World War II, but became a brainwashed sleeper agent and assassin for Hydra called the Winter Soldier. In the midst of stopping Hydra’s nefarious “Project Insight” program, Cap and Bucky battled, and Cap’s pleas to his old friend to remember who he was finally seemed to succeed, as Bucky saved Rogers from drowning, though he vanished in the aftermath.
                    Re-teaming with the Avengers to take out remaining Hydra cells brought Roger’s into contact with the enhanced siblings Wanda and Pietro Maximoff, as the Avengers retrieved the powerful staff Loki had used in his attempt to conquer Earth. After Tony Stark and Bruce Banner used the staff to help create a free-thinking robot called Ultron, only for Ultron to turn on humanity, Rogers took Stark to task over the situation, setting off a deep-seated disagreement between the two men. The Avengers, now joined by a regretful Wanda and Pietro, faced off with Ultron in the small nation of Sokovia, and although they defeated the robot, they failed to prevent the loss of Pietro or the devastation of the Sokovian people and their community.
                    Leading a new lineup of the Avengers, Captain America continued his work to fight criminals around the globe. But, when several innocents died during a confrontation with Cap’s enemy, Brock Rumlow, it set off a chain reaction that resulted in a United Nations-backed program called the Sokovia Accords, which would be used to register and control the actions of super humans and costumed champions. Steve Rogers and Tony Stark grappled with opposite opinions on the matter, with Rogers firmly against the concept of the Accords, which in turn led to the Avengers and various other heroes taking sides in the growing conflict. In the midst of this, Steve also had to deal with the death of the now-elderly Peggy Carter and was reunited with Sharon, who once again covertly helped him, while the two took tentative steps towards a romance.

                    During these events, Bucky also resurfaced after a lethal bomb was set off during a United Nation gathering over the Accords and the Winter Soldier was framed for the horrific act. The victims of that bombing included Wakanda's king, T’Chaka, leading his son, Prince T’Challa, the Black Panther, to seek revenge against Barnes. Inevitably, the tensions between Cap and his friends and their former teammates turned physical, with T’Challa among those fighting with Stark, as Rogers strove to protect Barnes and find the real culprit.
                    A truce was briefly called when Rogers and Stark both discovered the bombing was actually caused by Helmut Zemo, a Sokovian who lost his family during the Avengers battle against Ultron. However, the situation escalated again when Stark, as part of Zemo’s insidious plan to destroy the Avengers, learned that it was Barnes who had killed his parents years before and that Rogers had kept the information from him. In a bitter fight between Iron Man and Captain America, Rogers managed to eventually subdue Stark and walked away from the Avengers completely, leaving his shield behind. However, he sent Tony a message soon after, explaining his regrets over what had happened and letting Tony know he would be there for him should the need arise, leaving Stark a phone he could use to contact him if need be.
                    After breaking out the heroes who’d fought alongside him against Stark’s crew—and been imprisoned as a result—Steve Rogers accompanied Bucky Barnes to the technologically advanced nation of Wakanda to seek the aid of T’Challa, who also had learned of Barnes’ innocence in his father’s death. The Black Panther agreed to help his former foes, assuring Captain America it would be far from easy for any who may learn of Barnes’ presence in Wakanda and attempt to strike at him there.
                    For the next two years, Rogers remained on the run, staying in close contact with fellow fugitives Romanoff, Wilson, and Maximoff. Rogers eventually came out of hiding when Bruce Banner used the phone he’d left Stark to make contact, informing Rogers of the impending threat of Thanos, who was hunting for Vision’s mind stone. In Scotland, Rogers, Romanoff, and Wilson arrived in time to help fend off an attack against Maximoff and Vision by Thanos’ agents.
                    Briefly returning to Avengers headquarters in upstate New York, Rogers refused to accept Vision’s offer to have the mind stone destroyed knowing it would lead to Vision’s death. When it was suggested by Banner that there may be a way to remove the stone but keep Vision alive, Rogers once more sought help from T’Challa and the advanced science of Wakanda.
                    In Wakanda, Rogers and several fellow Avengers and allies, including Bucky, joined forces with T’Challa and his people to fight an army of Thanos’ followers, hoping to hold them off long enough for the stone to successfully be removed and destroyed. Despite their valiant effort, Thanos was able to gain possession of the mind stone, ripping it from Vision’s head and leaving him lifeless. Using his Infinity Gauntlet, now powered by all six infinity stones, Thanos snapped his fingers and extinguished half the life in the universe in one fell swoop. Rogers helplessly watched as many around him, including Bucky and other close friends, disintegrated before his eyes.

                <h3>The God of Thunder</h3>
                <p>
                    Thor was born to the King of the Asgardian Gods, Odin Borson, and the Earth Goddess Gaea. He grew up in Asgard under Odin's tutelage and trained in his footsteps to one day lead Asgard. Besides Odin, his stepmother Frigga and his adopted brother Loki are the only family he know, alongside his best friends Sif, Balder, and the Warriors Three.

                    Throughout his youth, Thor tested his limits on dangerous missions and became worthy of the Uru hammer Mjolnir, using it to save Sif from the Death Goddess Hela. While the hammer wields destructive powers, it also has the power to build and Thor also uses it to consecrate treaties and bless weddings.

                    In Thor's coming of age, he fell through a portal and battled the demigod Hercules. Equal in strength, they fought until Zeus halted their encounter, sending Thor back to Asgard and wiping the memories of both warriors. During the 9th Century, Thor spent time on Earth, leading Vikings into battle. It was not until Thor's loyal Vikings attacked a Christian monastery that he turned his back on his followers, leaving Earth and spending centuries in Asgard.

                    During his time in Asgard, Odin casted Thor into the mortal guise of Siegmund to retrieve the Rhinegold Ring from the dragon Fafnir. When Siegmund took away another's wife, Frigga compelled Odin to kill Thor, but Thor survived as Siegmund's son Siegfried. Odin succeeded at obtaining the Rhinegold Ring from Siegfried, then restored Thor to life without any memories of his former identities.

                    When Thor's battle-hungry appetite led him to break a treaty between Asgard and the Frost Giants, Odin banished him to Earth as a lesson in humility in the form of Dr. Donald Blake. As a human, he had a limp and worked as a physician. When he was compelled by Odin to go to Norway, he came upon extraterrestrials known as the Kronans and fled into a cave. There, he found a gnarled cane and used it to try and escape; he struck it against a rock, and it became Mjolnir. The mallet then restored his memories and returned him to his former glory as the mighty God of Thunder.
                    When Loki became a menace and deceived his brother Thor on Earth, Thor saw through his lies and banded together with Iron Man, the Hulk, Ant-Man, and Wasp to found the Avengers. Alongside the Avengers, Thor is a leader, master hand-to-hand combatant, and talented swordsman.

                <h3>Worthy Warrior and Weaponry</h3>
                <p>
                    Thor, son of Gods, has enhanced longevity, augmented by the Golden Apples of Idunn. He also possesses superhuman strength, speed, agility, durability and immunity to most diseases.

                    Thor's greatest weapon, and closest ally, is Mjolnir, an enchanted hammer forged from Uru metal, which has power over storms and can generate energy blasts known as anti-force. Thor uses this hammer to summon rain, wind, lightning, and thunder, though he has also been known to produce lightning from his hands. While Mjolnir can manipulate weather patterns, it extends godhood and many other abilities to its commander. When spun, the mallet can allow Thor to fly, hover, and even open portals to other dimensions and realms. When thrown, it acts as a sort of boomerang, destroying all things or beings in its path before returning to its owner.

                    When Thor became unworthy of holding Mjolnir, he used Jarnbjorn, a deadly war ax.
                    When the Casket of Ancient Winters was unleashed on Earth, it ushered forth Surtur and the cyclical end of Asgard known as Ragnarok. Surtur went to war with Asgard, and Thor joined Beta Ray Bill, the Avengers, and Fantastic Four to stop Surtur. Loki joined the fight, battling alongside Thor and Odin. Odin casted himself and Surtur from Asgard to seal the realms from his menace, placing them in eternal conflict.

                    The following battles found Thor up against Hela the Death Goddess, who disfigured and cursed him with the inability to heal his injuries. Loki saw this moment as another opportunity to defeat Thor and set Thor's enemies against him, including the Absorbing Man, the Midguard Serpent, and the Destroyer. Thor bested these foes and confronted Hela in Hel to lift the curse. Hela, in order to save herself, healed Thor's injuries and removed the spell.

                    Just as one death goddess was defeated, another surfaced in the form of Seth the Death God, who held Odin captive. In Thor's effort to free his father, Surtur followed. Then Odin temporarily granted Thor his Odinpower, helping him to triumph over Surtur.

                    After these wars, an acquaintance of Jarlson's, Eric Masterson, aided Thor on a mission, but was nearly killed. To save him, Odin merged him with Thor. But, Thor's new guise as Eric was problematic, since he was a real man and much more complicated than Blake; often his life interfered with Thor's adventures. Alas, Eric filled in for Thor when Thor became exiled in the back of their collective mind, and even faced Loki in battle. Eric, however, was not the last human that Thor merged with. Jake Olson was the next mortal to play host to Thor, but his body proved to be less than worthy for the might of the God.

                <h3>Allies, Friends, Family</h3>
                <p>
                    Thor's allies include Odin Borson, his father and King of the Asgardians; his mother and Earth Goddess Gaea; and his stepmother Frigga. His best friends include Sif (whom he has intermittent romances with), Balder, and the Warriors Three: Fandral the Dashing, Hogun the Grim, and Volstagg the Enormous.

                    The God Heimdall is the guardian of Asgard. He protects the Asgardian borders and the Bifrost, and is forever an ally to Thor.

                    On Earth, Thor bands together with Iron Man, the Hulk, Ant-Man, and the Wasp to found the Avengers. Later, when the Hulk leaves, Steve Rogers, AKA Captain America, joins the fold and becomes close friends with the God.
                    Beta Ray Bill, a warrior alien, bests Thor in battle one time. As a reward for his strength, Odin creates a new hammer known as Stormbreaker for Bill. Bill subsequently fights alongside Thor, the Avengers, and Fantastic Four during an engagement on Earth in battle with Surtur.

                    Eric Masterson, an acquaintance of one of Thor's secret identities, Sigurd Jarlson, becomes bonded to Thor and acts a guise for him. He, occasionally, gains control of their shared body, and even takes on the codename Thunderstrike.

                    Jane Foster, a human nurse that Donald Blake falls in love with, often finds herself wrapped up in Thor's orbit, whether romantically or as an ally. She also proves to be worthy of Mjolnir and even takes on the mantle of Thor.
                </p>
                <h3>Rolling Thunder</h3>
                <p>
                    Thor then turned to Doctor Strange to help him restore Mjolnir. It was bonded to Thor's life force so that any injury to the hammer would affect Thor. It was then that Thor learned of Sif's fate, allowing him to restore her to her body. Sif, the Warriors Three, and Thor then chose to settle in exile in Broxton before Asgard was finally restored to its own realm.
                    Thor Odinson eventually became unworthy of Mjolnir and his former lover Jane Foster took up the mantle of Thor in his stead. Possessing all his godhood and powers via the hammer, she battled as the Goddess of Thunder. The Odinson, along with his new weapon, the battle ax Jarnbjorn, departed to fight across the realms on his own.

                    When Jane Foster's cancer-ridden body could no longer take the rigors of godhood, she chose to battle a rampaging Mangog one last time in an effort to save Asgard from total destruction. In her final battle, she managed to defeat the monster, and allowed the Asgardian people time to escape the destruction. Jane Foster  then stepped down from the mantle, allowing the God of Thunder to serve as Thor once again.
